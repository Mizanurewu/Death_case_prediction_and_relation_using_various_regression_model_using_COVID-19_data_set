# Death_case_prediction_and_relation_using_various_regression_model_using_COVID-19_data_set
o	In this work simple linear regression, multiple and polynomial linear regression has been implemented. The dataset has been collected from the (DGHS) Directorate General of Health Services, Bangladesh. It has 626 rows and 4 columns.

o	The main aim of this work is to find out the relationship of death cases with test cases, positive cases, first vaccines and second vaccines.

o	Polynomial regression performs the better accuracy and the mean absolute error has been found 14.65%. and has a strong relation between the number of death cases and positive cases.
